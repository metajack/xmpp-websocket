  http://blog.vlad1.com/2009/11/06/canvasarraybuffer-and-canvasarray/
  Chris Blizzard: "Note that we're working on adding interfaces to
  expose this from XHR, Vlad has expressed interest in doing the same
  to the WebSocket DOM interfaces and we're working on one from the
  File API as well. Basically anywhere where the browser is expected
  to handle a big pile of binary data, we should probably be exposing
  interfaces to expose them as native arrays."
